# Introduction
This is an introduction to Reproducibility in R.

Hello, Website!

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html.

Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.

## Starting with Rstudio
Information about R studio

### Opening R studio
Show the different panes

Add table of Contents to organize your script.

Bold text **Bold text**
or by __I am bold using double underscores__

For Italics *Italics* or _italics_

Add superscript ^It^
Add subscript ~tidle~

Add inline code to write code using backtick 'code'
Use double with underscores to strikethrough  ~~double~~ once
